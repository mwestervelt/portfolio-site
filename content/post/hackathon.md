## Flatiron School // Access Labs Hackathon

#### A Saturday

* **9:00 am**: Arrive super hungry, eat all the free breakfast foods with my teammates Ana, Gracie, Julissa, and Milan; and discuss early ideas.
* **9:15 am**: Catch up with all the current and former fellow Flatiron students at the hackathon. Much excite, very wow.
* **9:30 am**: Organizers start going over the rules, introduce the Subject Matter Experts, Tech Mentors, others.
* **10:30 am**: Get to our designated table and start ideating, pros/cons of each. Figure out feasibility for finishing something in the next 8ish hours. Since the theme of this hackathon was health, and our team was all women, we wanted to focus on a women's health issue.
* **11:00 am**: We are zeroing in on our idea. We had several very helpful SME's in the health industry give us some great guidance on the scope of our project, which started as a birth control/emergency contraception delivery service, then pivoted to a period tracker, then pivoted again to an educational tool specifically for teens.
* **11:30 am**: Hacking begins. We have a problem statement and a design statement pretty well thought out. We cut the period tracker/calendar view component. We have one repo with 5 contributors and responsibilities are delegated. We made the decision to forgo having login/user data stored anywhere period (hehe) at all since we wanted it to be anonymous.
* **11:45 am**: At some point we made a "Do not disturb" sign and put it on our table because we had sooo many people coming up and asking to explain our idea. It was good to practice pitching the idea so many times, but it also was taking away from coding and at times, de-railing us.
* **12:30 pm**: PIZZA BREAK üçï
* **1:30 pm**: Resume hacking. The idea has solidified and everyone is in the zone.
* **2-7 pm**: Honestly a blur.
* **7:15 pm**: Realize it's about time to present. The final CSS touches are being added and my teammate Ana and I are practicing our pitch quickly.
* **8:00 pm**: Everyone assembles for pitches and judges are introduced. Judging criteria and prizes are discussed. There will be two winners - one who used Blockstack (a sponsor of the hackathon, essentially blockchain based authentication/data-storage) and one group that did not. There are 16 groups so we are in for a long night!
* **9:00 pm**: We present our web app. It works. It's fairly straightforward. We answered the question we came to solve. It's designed well.
* **9:30 pm**: The winners are announced. Our group was chosen as one of the winners!!
* **10:00 pm**: CELEBRATE
