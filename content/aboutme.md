## My Story
Born and raised in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee), I studied Opera in college and continued to sing and teach lessons while working at a call center. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I held positions as marketing manager and executive assistant, but decided to make a major career leap after years of working in tech-adjacent roles. Done with watching from the sidelines while the coders did all the cool stuff that I wanted to do, I fell in love with programming at first deploy. I graduated from the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive in early 2019.


When not coding, you can find me walking in the park, singing karaoke, exploring Williamsburg, or looking for a new favorite donut shop. I love animals, beauty & fashion, design, and learning new things.
