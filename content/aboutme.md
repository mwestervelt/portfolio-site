## My Story
Born and raised in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee), I studied Opera in college and continued to sing and teach lessons while working at a call center. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I held positions as marketing manager and executive assistant, but decided to make a major career leap after years of working in tech-adjacent roles. Done with watching from the sidelines, I fell in love with programming at "Hello world" and graduated from the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive in early 2019.


When not coding, you can find me walking in the park, singing karaoke, exploring Williamsburg, or looking for a new favorite donut shop. I love music, animals, beauty & fashion, design, and learning new things.
