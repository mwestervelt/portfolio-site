## My Story
Born and raised in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee), I studied Opera in college and continued to sing and teach lessons. I decided to make a major career change after years of working in tech-adjacent roles. I fell in love with programming and web development at first deploy.


I graduated from the Flatiron School's Software Engineering immersive in early 2019.


When not coding, you can find me walking in the park, singing karaoke, exploring Williamsburg, or looking for a new favorite donut shop. I love animals, beauty & fashion, design, and learning new things.
